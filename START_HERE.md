# 🚀 START HERE - Local Deployment

## ✅ Everything You Need is Ready!

All files for local deployment are in this folder:
```
C:\Users\VICTOR KIBENGE\Desktop\Dep\dep\military_screening\
```

---

## 🎯 THREE WAYS TO START

### 🥇 OPTION 1: Automatic Setup (Easiest)

**Just run this one command:**

```powershell
.\start.ps1
```

This script will:
- ✅ Create virtual environment
- ✅ Install all dependencies
- ✅ Ask if you want CSV feature
- ✅ Start the application
- ✅ Open browser automatically

**Time:** 5-10 minutes (first time only)

---

### 🥈 OPTION 2: Test First, Then Deploy

**Step 1: Test your setup**
```powershell
.\test_deployment.ps1
```
This checks if all files are present and ready.

**Step 2: If all tests pass, run:**
```powershell
.\start.ps1
```

---

### 🥉 OPTION 3: Manual Step-by-Step

**For complete control, follow these commands:**

```powershell
# 1. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# 2. Activate it
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. (Optional) Enable CSV feature
Copy-Item app_with_csv.py app.py -Force

# 5. Run the app
python app.py

# 6. Open browser
Start-Process "http://localhost:5000"
```

## 🐛 Quick Fixes

### Problem: "Cannot run script"
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Problem: "Python not found"
1. Install Python 3.9+ from python.org
2. Make sure "Add to PATH" is checked during installation
3. Restart PowerShell

### Problem: "Port 5000 already in use"
```powershell
# Find what's using port 5000
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5000

# Or just restart your computer
```

### Problem: "Model file not found"
- Don't worry! The `.7z` file will auto-extract on first run
- Just wait 30-60 seconds during startup

2. **Create test data** - Generate sample CSV files
3. **Document issues** - Note anything that doesn't work
4. **Deploy to Render** - Follow cloud deployment guide
